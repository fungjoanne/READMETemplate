# README Template

ADD THIS: This should not be optional. We use Readmes heavily. This is the most common place our engineers look when they find issues.  A support section that contains common issues and so on...Something like:

Support/Runbook:
- FAQs
- Runbooks
- Support Info

Alyssa's comment to above: You could also call this "Troubleshooting." You might want to include a suggested way of formatting this information. I find a table works well. I saw a really good example of this in a hardware installation guide the other day that I can share. Remind me to share it.

*Note: Please refer to the README template guide on instructions how to use this template.*

## Contributing guidelines
Include clear instructions on how users can help with the project.

NOTE FROM DANIEL B.: It might be wise to call out having a CONTRIBUTING file and linking to it, as an alternative to having this content inline. Particularly on GitHub. The GitHub UI will highlight your CONTRIBUTING file to new contributors, which might be preferable to hoping they've read the whole README
 
- Open source projects: presence of these guidelines strongly indicates that project stakeholders have experience with working with new contributors.
  - Mode of contribution (e.g., via GitHub pull requests or patches mailed to a specific address)
  - Code style/requirements
  - Format for commit messages
- Closed source projects: instructions on how to report bugs.

## Terms of use
COMMENT FROM MORGAN: Terms of use is dictated by what is in the LICENSE file.  Unless the individual doesn't have a LICENSE....

I usually put this info at the bottom of a readme.  If you're code is public on github I'm going to assume it is a permissible license.... otherwise what were you thinking putting your proprietary code publicly.... hehe
