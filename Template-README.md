# README Template

EDITING NOTE: Add curly brackets around project because writers should be including the name of their project 

ADD THIS: This should not be optional. We use Readmes heavily. This is the most common place our engineers look when they find issues.  A support section that contains common issues and so on...Something like:

Support/Runbook:
- FAQs
- Runbooks
- Support Info

Alyssa's comment to above: You could also call this "Troubleshooting." You might want to include a suggested way of formatting this information. I find a table works well. I saw a really good example of this in a hardware installation guide the other day that I can share. Remind me to share it.

*Note: Please refer to the README template guide on instructions how to use this template.*


## Project Logo 
Optional but recommended as it signals that that someone cares enough about the project to create a logo.

## Project Name 
Should be the first heading or in plain text
- Project URL (optional)
- Name of project owner (optional, may want to consider including owners in a contact document instead)

## Table of contents 
NOTE: Add TOC [link here](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/templates/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md?plain=1)
Optional but useful in case of lengthy READMEs

## Project description 
Most important part! Should be succinct and clearly describe what the project does. Should help the reader determine immediately whether it is of use to them.  

(from Daniel Beck)
             With *(this project)* you can *(verb)* *(noun)*...
             *(This project)* helps you *(verb)* *(noun)*....
             Unlike *(alternative)*, *)this project)* *(verb)* *(noun)*... 


- CHECK THIS OUT: REMOVE?Include badges (optional - pro: signal that maintainers care about code quality; con: problematic if inaccurate, may erode confidence)
- Include screenshots/demo videos

## Who this project is for 
State who may use the project and under what terms (preferable to state this information higher up in README - will help the reader evaluate whether the project is suitable for them).  

## Project dependencies
List things you need to use the software and ideally include links to instructions/resources on how to install them. 

## Instructions for using project
Describe in a stepwise manner how to use the project. Include only essential information and ensure that it actually works. Steps may include:  

NOTE: Update the following to H3s
- How to get the project
- How to install the project
- How to configure the project
- How to run the project
- Common error messages/related details
- Tests (optional)
 
## Additional documentation
Include links (if available) and brief descriptions for more resources such as:
- Website
- Twitter handle(s) of project/project owner(s) 
- Relevant examples
- Next steps
- Features planned
- Known bugs
- Documentation files
- Man page
- Help command(s)
 
 
## How to get help
Include links and brief descriptions for avenues for assistance:
- Google group/mailing list 
- Email address(es)
- IRC, Slack, or Discord channels 
- Bug trackers
- Other support resources (such as Stack Overflow tags)
 
## Contributing guidelines
Include clear instructions on how users can help with the project.

NOTE FROM DANIEL B.: It might be wise to call out having a CONTRIBUTING file and linking to it, as an alternative to having this content inline. Particularly on GitHub. The GitHub UI will highlight your CONTRIBUTING file to new contributors, which might be preferable to hoping they've read the whole README
 
- Open source projects: presence of these guidelines strongly indicates that project stakeholders have experience with working with new contributors.
  - Mode of contribution (e.g., via GitHub pull requests or patches mailed to a specific address)
  - Code style/requirements
  - Format for commit messages
- Closed source projects: instructions on how to report bugs.

## Terms of use
COMMENT FROM MORGAN: Terms of use is dictated by what is in the LICENSE file.  Unless the individual doesn't have a LICENSE....

I usually put this info at the bottom of a readme.  If you're code is public on github I'm going to assume it is a permissible license.... otherwise what were you thinking putting your proprietary code publicly.... hehe
