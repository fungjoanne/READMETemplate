## Terms of use
COMMENT FROM MORGAN: Terms of use is dictated by what is in the LICENSE file.  Unless the individual doesn't have a LICENSE....

I usually put this info at the bottom of a readme.  If you're code is public on github I'm going to assume it is a permissible license.... otherwise what were you thinking putting your proprietary code publicly.... hehe
