# README Template Guide

---
## Things to discuss with group 

1. Two types of README: Should we have two templates for READMEs? Find an example... there are repo-level READMEs, folder-level READMEs, and project-level READMEs. READMEs operate at different scopes - which scope are we focusing on for this project? 
2. README Evolution: How do we convey to users that READMEs are supposed to evolve over time? List out the many functions a README could have, and what other documents could have that function... README can be the starter document and can reference other templates/guides in GoodDocs for more mature projects. For the group: what other types of functions does a README have that could be developed into another template/guide? 

Alyssa Comment from Google Doc: You might also want to note where the file is typically placed in the project folder and how it is displayed in GitHub/GitLab. (It's basically the front page when you visit the root folder for a project.)

FOR NEXT DISCUSSION: To discuss with group: including badges in README or not? What's the benefit?
Cameron's Comment: I'm against including badges and similar metrics. Reasons:
1. Keep to task.
2. Metrics change, and you are introducing a maintenance burden, which effectively means your README will become dated.
3. There are better places to find metrics data (E.g. from github metrics), don't repeat it here.

READMes are the first document users read. They tell users what they need to know about your project, if the project is relevant to the user, and how they can engage with the project. 

All projects include a README, and users will expect to have a README available for review. In some cases, larger projects may include sub-READMEs - separate, smaller READMEs that support subfolders in the project.

*Note: As your project evolves and grows, so must your README file. READMEs should be revisited regularly to ensure relevant information is captured for new users.*

Badges may also be included in your README 

## The Project Logo
A project logo is optional, but helpful for users to visually identify your project. Many READMEs include a logo, especially if the project already has an existing logo.

## The Project Name
The project name should be prominent and easy for the reader to identify. You may want to consider adding the following to help identify the project:
- Project URL
- Name(s) of project owner(s) , may want to consider including owners in a contact document instead)

    *Note: Consider that adding owners may be better suited for inclusion in a separate contact document instead*


## The Table of Contents
A Table of Contents is optional, but they can be especially useful in the case of lengthy READMEs. As the project evolves, the README may eventually require a Table of Contents for information organization.

For Markdown files, GitHub now automatically generates a Table of Contents in the Header.

## Project description
The project description is the most critical part of your README. This is where you will describe what the project does, why the reader should care about your project, and how it will help the reader. This section should be succinct, use strong verbs, and help the reader determine whether the project is of use to them.  

Screenshots or videos may also be included in this section to help readers understand your project. Any assets you direct users to should exist in the repo.

Use the below to start filling in your project description. 


             With *(this project)* you can *(verb)* *(noun)*...
             *(This project)* helps you *(verb)* *(noun)*....
             Unlike *(alternative)*, *)this project)* *(verb)* *(noun)*...

Example: With the Chronologue project, you can discover astronomical events through history. This project helps you understand the evolution of space in a streamlined format. Unlike googling for important space events in the 18th century, the Chronologue project outlines historical events with an easy to use and simple interface.

## Who is the project for
State who may use the project and under what terms (preferable to state this information higher up in README - will help the reader evaluate whether the project is suitable for them).  

## Project prerequisites
List things you need to use the software and ideally include links to instructions/resources on how to install them. 

## Instructions for using project
Describe in a stepwise manner how to use the project. Include only essential information and ensure that it actually works. Steps may include:  

- How to get the project
- How to install the project
- How to configure the project
- How to run the project
- Common error messages/related details
- Tests (optional)
 
## Additional documentation
Include links (if available) and brief descriptions for more resources such as:
- Website
- Twitter handle(s) of project/project owner(s) 
- Relevant examples
- Next steps
- Features planned
- Known bugs
- Documentation files
- Man page
- Help command(s)
 
 
## How to get help
Include links and brief descriptions for avenues for assistance:
- Google group/mailing list 
- Email address(es)
- IRC, Slack, or Discord channels 
- Bug trackers
- Other support resources (such as Stack Overflow tags)
 
## Contributing guidelines
Include clear instructions on how users can help with the project.
 
- Open source projects: presence of these guidelines strongly indicates that project stakeholders have experience with working with new contributors.
  - Mode of contribution (e.g., via GitHub pull requests or patches mailed to a specific address)
  - Code style/requirements
  - Format for commit messages
- Closed source projects: instructions on how to report bugs.
